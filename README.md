This library enables you to add webhooks to a Django project for any create/update/delete
events on your models with a simple configuration. New webhooks can be added in the
admin panel, with or without authentication, with plenty of hooks into the webhook sending
process to customize them for your needs.

```python
# project/settings.py

# Add to instaled apps
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "signal_webhooks",
    ...
]

# Add default webhook configuration to the User model
SIGNAL_WEBHOOKS = {
    "HOOKS": {
        "django.contrib.auth.models.User": ...,
    },
}
```
